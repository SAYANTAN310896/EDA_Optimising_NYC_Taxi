# EDA-on_Optimising-NYC-Taxi-Data

•	Conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on New York City taxi data and visualizing it through using Python and it's libraries.

### About the project
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in data analysis, helping us understand the structure, patterns, and characteristics of a dataset. In this example, we'll perform EDA on New York City taxi data using Python and various libraries. We'll visualize the data different plots to gain insights. In which we performed Descriptive and Diagnostic Analysis. We have used the NYC taxi dataset from Upgrad and IITB Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
